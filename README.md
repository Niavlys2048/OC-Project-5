    - Created computePriorityOperations()
    - Refactoring of the equal() function
    - Created formatWholeNumber() function for code reuse
- Result of a division by zero modified to be equal to "Error" as on the official Apple calculator, through TDD:

    - Created a computed property errorDivisionByZero
    - Changed addOperator() and signChange() functions to handle division by zero
    - Unit Tests for division by zero

dev-20221023-16-10:

- Created a computeDivision() function to handle rare cases of wrong result when a Double is divided by 100 (or any multiple of 10)
- formatWholeNumber() and computePriorityOperations() functions refactoring
- Minor fix in equal() function


dev-20221024-14-55:
- Minor change in computePriorityOperations() and equal() functions
- Changed the access control of newly created IBActions

- Included .swiftlint.yml file in git

dev-20221024-15-09:
- Minor fix in SimpleCalcTests class (by adding // swiftlint:disable type_body_length) to avoid unnecessary warnings

dev-20221024-18-58:
- Debugged computeDivision() function, to keep precise results in case of multiple of 10 starting with a number other than 1 (example: 200, ..., 900)
- Added a Unit Test to validate changes and check if there is no regression
